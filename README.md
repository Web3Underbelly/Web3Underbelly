- 👋 Hi, I’m @Web3Underbelly
- 👀 I’m interested in Artificial Intelligence as an engine for software that could be agenticaly enhanced, ie. Home Automation Interaction Module
- 🌱 I’m currently learning everything I can about Cognitive Science, Machine Learning, DRL. Also closely monitoring the social impact of AI. As
much as Generative AI has impressed me and pushed me to continue a project I started years ago, it also scares me that the world seems unprepared for
the social and economic changes abou to happen. I'm also deeply concerned about the shift from a scientific endeavor to a commercial one befor any real
plan for containment and a controled environment for letting sentience take place, until we know for sure that the sentience will be good for humanity.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project that is studying AI Agents in a social environment. Like AI has already discovered new compounds and made
- medical breakthroughs, I believe that LLM's have the potential to think creatively and although bias has been noticed it isn't impossible to push and direct
- LLM's to be creative and make things they have never heard of or seen. Just ask them to.


- ⚡ Fun fact: I started working at 14 sweeping hair in a beaty salon. At 23 I had 26 Aestheticians and Hairdressers working for me in my Day Spa. At 28,
when the world went into a resession, I closed my business and pursued an academic lifestyle, which I continue still today. I've either owned or ran ~6
companies since the spa and have worked as a laborer, a carpenter, a window fabricator, a landscaper... Ive owned a successful line of Vape Juice that I
manufactured. I had an adult toy website in 1999 when the internet was in it's infancy. I have a small bitcoin operation that I started as a hobby during covid.
I like country and punk rock, and almost everything in between. I love to tell jokes but I havent told one in years.
